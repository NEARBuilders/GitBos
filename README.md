## Overview

Let's connect, collaborate, and create solutions together!

This repository holds the front-end widgets for [Build DAO Gateway](https://nearbuilders.org/). It is configured as a [bos-workspace](https://github.com/nearbuilders/bos-workspace).

## Setup & Development

1. Install packages

```cmd
yarn install
```

2. Start development version in mainnet:

```cmd
yarn dev
```

Or start the development version in testnet:

```cmd
yarn dev:testnet
```

This will start a gateway at <http://127.0.0.1:8080> which will render your local widgets. The entry point for this app is [builddao.near/widget/Index](http://127.0.0.1:8080/builddao.near/widget/Index).
