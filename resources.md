# Ideation: Resources Page 
Opening this file as a place where we can collect ideas, links, etc for the [Resources](https://www.nearbuilders.org/resources) page

## Existing content
If you have anything already made floating around out there, let's start collecting links and similar here:

### Components

### Writings
(blog posts, socials posts, anything that isn't docs but is written content)

### Key doc links
(what do you send devs to read when they onboard?)

### Tools? 

## Needs built out
What do we need to write, build, etc to cover everything we want to make available? If it doesn't already exist, it goes here
